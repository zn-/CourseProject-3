### Original Data

The original data comes from the smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals, which have been processed using various signal processing techniques to measure vector consisting of 561 features. For detailed description of the original dataset, please see features_info.txt in the unzipped dataset file.

The dataset includes the following files:

*'README.txt'

*'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

*'features.txt': List of all features.

*'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

*'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

*'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

*'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

*'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

### The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are-

*'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

*'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

*'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

*'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

### Transformation details

There are 5 parts:

*Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.

*Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

*Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

*Appropriately labelling the data set with descriptive activity names.

*Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
