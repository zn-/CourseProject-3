CourseProject-3
===============
(This Project is done as part of Getting and Cleaning data course of Coursera)

Here I have described how run_analysis.R script works.

First, Get the data(by downloading) from the link provided in project page and rename the folder as "data3".
Make sure the folder "data3" and the run_analysis.R script are both in the current working directory.
Second, use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio.
Third, you will find two output files are generated in the current working directory:
merged_data.txt (7.9 Mb): it contains a data frame called cleanedData with 10299*68 dimension.
data_with_means.txt (220 Kb): it contains a data frame called result with 180*68 dimension.
Finally, use data <- read.table("data_with_means.txt") command in RStudio to read the file. Since we are required to get the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, and there are 6 activities in total and 30 subjects in total, we have 180 rows with all combinations for each of the 66 features.
